				The US Department of State on its webiste maintains a list of Travel Advisories for every country since
				1994. The list is updated every year and is based on the information provided by the US Embassies in the
				respective countries.
				The travel advisories are not just limited to travelers but also US officials travelling to a foreign
				country.
			</p>
			<p class="fontCat">
				The current travel advisories are divided into three categories: Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts and Country
				Specific
				Consular Information Sheet.

			</p>
			<p class="fontCat">
				Previously, advisories consisted of Travel Warnings and Public Announcements. Later, the public announcements
				are changed to
				travel alerts.
				The format of the advisories has been changed by the US Department of State since 2020. The advisories are
				classified
				into four levels of risk: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3
				(Reconsider
				Travel) and Level 4 (Do Not Travel).
			</p>
			<p class="fontCat">
				Reading through the travel advisories since 2020, it is clear that Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) and Level 4 (Do
				Not
				Travel) are nothing but Travel Alerts and Travel Warnings.
			</p>
			<p class="fontCat">
				In 2022 the US Department of State introduced a new advisory level called Other.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2 class="fontPT">What are US Travel Advisories?</h2>

			<p class="fontCat">
				A travel warning, travel alert, or travel advisory is an official
				warning statement issued by US government Department of State to
				provide information about the relative safety of travelling to or
				visiting one or more specific foreign countries or destinations. The
				purpose is to enable travelers to make an informed decision about a
				particular travel destination, and to help travelers prepare
				adequately for what may be encountered on their trip.

				want you to know the risks of traveling to these places and to

				like an outbreak of H1N1, Covid-19; or evidence of an elevated risk of

			<h2>Is there a bias in issuing the travel warnings and alerts?</h2>
			<p>
				I analysed the data to see if there was a bias in the issuing of travel advisories.
				From the initial data analysis I found that most travel alerts and warnings are issues
				for the countries that are Under developed and developing countries.

			</p>
			<p>
				To analyze the data and confirm the bias, I used the following criteria
				to split the countries into different categories based on their:
			<ul>
				<li>Economic Power Index (EPI) of the country</li>
				<li>Freedom of the Press Index (FPI) of the country</li>
				<li>Political Rights and Civil Liberties of people in the country</li>

			<h3>Economic Power Index (EPI) of the country</h2>
				<p>
					The United nation's World Economic Situation and Prospects (W.E.S.P.) report classified the countries of the
					world into seven categories based on their economic power.

				<ul class="advisoryp">
					<li>Developed region: G7</li>
					<li>Developed region: nonG7</li>
					<li>Emerging region: BRIC</li>

					<li>Emerging region: G20</li>
					<li>Developing region</li>
					<li>Least developed region</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="advisoryp">
					The visualisation below shows the number of travel warnings issued for each
					of the regions. Only 0.3% (4 out of 1266) of the travel warnings were issued
					for the developed G7 nations. All 4 of the travel warnings were issued in 2021 because
					of the COVID-19 pandemic.
				</p>
				<p class="advisoryp">
					7% (89 of 1266) of the travel warnings were issued for the Developed nonG7 nations. 29 of them are
					in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
					Israel ans Saudi Arabia are the only two countries in this category that account for 61 warnings.

					0.6% (8 of 1266) of the travel warnings were issued for the Emerging BRIC nations.

					4.2% (54 of 1266) of the travel warnings were issued for the Emerging MIKT nations.

					14% (185 of 1266) of the travel warnings were issued for the Emerging G20 nations.

					33% (421 of 1266) of the travel warnings were issued for the Developing nations.
