				The US Department of State on its website maintains a list of Travel Advisories for every country since
				1994. The list is updated from time to time. When the Department of State develops a travel advisory, it
				relies on U.S. embassies and consulates to gather information from a range of sources. This information
				may include, among other things, publicly available crime statistics or specialized knowledge from
				regional experts. The travel advisories are not just limited to travelers but also to US officials
				traveling to a foreign country.
			</p>

			<br>
			<h2 class="fontPT">What are US Travel Advisories?</h2>


			<p class="fontCat">
				Travel advisories begin with a description of the circumstances that justify advising US citizens to
				postpone
				non-essential travel. The phrase and recommendation to postpone non-essential travel is a
				recurring
				theme
				throughout the advisories.
			</p>

			<p class="fontCat">
				<!-- A travel warning, travel alert, or travel advisory is an official warning statement issued by the 
				US government Department of State to provide information about the relative safety of traveling 
				to or visiting one or more specific foreign countries or destinations.  -->
				The purpose is to enable travelers to make an informed decision about a
				particular travel destination, and to help travelers prepare adequately
				for what may be encountered on their trip.
			</p>
			<!-- <p class="fontCat">
				The US Department of State will occasionally state that embassy and consular services in a particular
				country are
				limited and that US personnel may be
				unable to
				assist a US traveler in need.
			</p> -->

			<!-- <p class="fontCat">
				Travel advisories may also include risk indicators, which detail specific safety and/or security risks
				in a
				country.
				Current risk indicators include:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Crime
				</li>
				<li>
					Terrorist activity
				</li>
				<li>
					Civil unrest
				</li>
				<li>
					Natural disasters
				</li>
				<li>
					Health concerns
				</li>
				<li>
					Kidnapping or hostage-taking
				</li>
				<li>
					Wrongful detention
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p class="fontCat">
				The wrongful detention indicator is the newest.
				It was introduced in June 2022 and warns US citizens of
				the risk
				of being wrongfully detained by a foreign government while in that country.
			</p>
			<p class="fontCat">
				This could be because of the WNBA player Brittney Griner who was detained at a Moscow airport in
				February 2022
				while she was in the country playing for UMMC Ekaterinburg during the
				WNBA off-season.

			<h2 class="fontPT">US Travel Advisories Today</h2>

				The US Department of State has changed the format of the advisories since 2018.

                    because a lot of people travel to Mexico for vacation and the country is neighboring
                    the United States. It can be proved with the Travel data from 1999-2022.
                    Mexico is the second highest visited country by US citizens with 587.99 million
                    travelers behind Canada with 627.77 million travelers.

				I analyzed the data to see if there was a bias in the issuing of travel advisories.
                From the initial data analysis, I found that most travel alerts and warnings are issues
                for the countries that are Underdeveloped and developing countries.

			<p>
				To analyze the data and confirm the bias, I used the following criteria
                to split the countries into different categories based on their:
			<ul>
				<li>Economic Power Index (EPI) of the country</li>
				<li>Freedom of the Press Index (FPI) of the country</li>

			<h3>Categories of countries</h2>
				<p>
					With the use of the above criteria, I classified the countries into the following categories:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Category 1: Developed Countries with better FPI and high individual Freedom</li>
					<li>Category 2: Developed Countries with low FPI and low individual Freedom</li>
					<li>Category 3: Emerging Countries with better FPI and high individual Freedom</li>
					<li>Category 4: Emerging Countries with low FPI and low individual Freedom</li>
					<li>Category 5: Developing Countries with better FPI and high individual Freedom</li>
					<li>Category 6: Developing Countries with low FPI and low individual Freedom</li>
					<li>Category 7: Under Developed Countries with better FPI and high individual Freedom</li>
					<li>Category 8: Under Developed Countries with low FPI and low individual Freedom</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p class="advisoryp">
					The below graph shows the number of travel warnings issued for each category of countries.
                    It can be clearly observed that Category 4, Category 6, and Category 8 i.e the countries with Low
                    Freedom of
                    Press Index
                    and Low Individual Freedom in the Country has the highest
                    number of travel warnings issued between 1994-2022.

				This data analysis raises several questions.
				Is the absence of Travel Warnings simply due to the relative safety of
				Category 1 (i.e., Advantaged) nations?
				Are the other Category nations merely more hazardous? This relationship
				does indeed seem to exist.

				Do americans heed the travel advisories?
			</h2>
			<p class="advisoryp">
				An article from NBC News in 2011 says that many Americans ignore the travel advisories
				issued by the U.S. State Department.
			</p>
			<div class="news">
				<div>
					<h3 class="advisoryp">Many Americans ignore 'overly cautious' U.S. travel alerts</h3>
					<p>
						Many Americans who venture abroad rarely listen to travel alerts issued by the U.S. State
						Department
						because, they
						contend, the advisories are "overly cautious" and too vague to offer practical value.
					</p>
				</div>

			</div>
			<p class="advisoryp">
				It is challenging to estimate the number of Americans who read travel warnings and alerts, and it is
				even more
				challenging to determine whether they follow the State Department's recommendations.
			</p>
			<p class="advisoryp">
				One way to gauge the impact of travel advisories is to look at the number of
				Americans who travel to a country from the US Department of Transport
				International Departures report (1990-2022).
			</p>
			<div class="flourish-embed flourish-table datatable" data-src="visualisation/12089104">
				<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
			</div>
			<p class="advisoryp">
				The top 20 countries have the highest number (78/100%) of American International
				Travelers traveling to them.
				And out of the top 20 countries, 12 countries are Category 1 countries.
			</p>
			<p class="advisoryp">
				Mexico has 19 travel warnings issued between 1994-2022.
				But it is the 2nd most visited country by Americans.
			</p>
			<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy datatable" data-src="visualisation/12089311">
				<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
			</div>
		</article>
		<p class="advisoryp">
			The chart above also confirms that Category 1 countries have the highest number
			of Americans traveling to them. Category 7 and 8 countries have the lowest
			American travelers.
		</p>
		<p class="advisoryp">
			Eventhough this doesn't provide a conclusive answer to the question, there seems to be
			some correlation between the number of Americans traveling to a country and the travel advisory.
		</p>

		<h3 class="advisoryp">Are the US Travel Advisories 'overly cautious'?</h3>
		<p class="advisoryp">
			One person certainly thinks so. Watch the video below to know what he has to say.

			<p>
				Even though the data tells us that the US travel advisories are biased and overly cautious, it is better 
				to follow the advisories as they are issued by the US State Department in the 
				interest of American citizens.
