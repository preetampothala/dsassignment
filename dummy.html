      <p class="fontCat">
        A travel warning, travel alert, or travel advisory is an official
        warning statement issued by US government Department of State to
        provide information about the relative safety of travelling to or
        visiting one or more specific foreign countries or destinations. The
        purpose is to enable travelers to make an informed decision about a
        particular travel destination, and to help travellers prepare
        adequately for what may be encountered on their trip.

        We issue a Travel Warning when we want you to consider very carefully
        whether you should go to a country at all. Examples of reasons for
        issuing a Travel Warning might include unstable government, civil war,
        ongoing intense crime or violence, or frequent terrorist attacks. We
        want you to know the risks of traveling to these places and to
        strongly consider not going to them at all. Travel Warnings remain in
        place until the situation changes; some have been in effect for years
        (travel.state.gov)

        We issue a Travel Alert for short-term events we think you should know
        about when planning travel to a country. Examples of reasons for
        issuing a Travel Alert might include an election season that is bound
        to have many strikes, demonstrations, or disturbances; a health alert
        like an outbreak of H1N1, Covid-19; or evidence of an elevated risk of
        terrorist attacks. When these short-term events are over, we cancel
        the Travel Alert (travel.state.gov)

          government security officials including for detention, the arbitrary
          enforcement of local law, limited flights into and out of Russia,
          the Embassy’s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia,
          COVID-19-related restrictions, and terrorism. U.S. citizens residing
          or travelling in Russia should depart Russia immediately. Exercise

        </p>
        <p class="advisoryp">
          Country Summary: U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Iran have
          been kidnapped, arrested, and detained on spurious charges. The
          Department has determined that at least one U.S. national is
          wrongfully detained by the Iranian government.

        <p class="advisoryp">
          Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S.
          nationals, particularly dual national U.S.-Iranian
          nationals--including students, journalists, business travelers, and
          academics--on charges including espionage and posing a threat to
          national security. Iranian authorities routinely delay consular
          access to detained U.S. nationals and consistently deny consular

          The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations

          continues to warn against travel to Colombia, and notes a continuing threat in urban areas throughout
          Colombia. This supersedes the Travel Warning issued December 19, 2003.
        </p>
        <p class="advisoryp">
          The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to Colombia. Violence by narcoterrorist groups and
          other criminal elements continues to affect all parts of the country, urban and rural. Citizens of the United
          States and other countries continue to be the victims of threats, kidnappings, and other violence. Colombian
          terrorist groups also operate in the border areas of neighboring countries, creating similar dangers for
          travelers in those areas. Bombings have caused civilian casualties throughout Colombia. Targets include
          supermarkets, places of entertainment, and other areas where U.S. citizens congregate. There have been no
          security incidents, to our knowledge, on San Andres Island (off the coast of Nicaragua).
        </p>
        <p class="advisoryp">
          About 2,200 kidnapping incidents were reported throughout Colombia in 2003. Since the year 2000, 28 Americans
          were reported kidnapped in various parts of the country. American kidnap or murder victims have included
          journalists, missionaries, scientists, human rights workers, U.S. government employees and businesspeople, as
          well as persons on tourism or family visits, and even small children. No one can be considered immune on the
          basis of occupation, nationality or any other factor. Most kidnappings of U.S. citizens in Colombia have been
          committed by terrorist groups, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National
          Liberation Army (ELN), which have been designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the Secretary of
          State. Since it is U.S. policy not to make concessions to, or strike deals with, terrorists, the U.S.
          government’s ability to assist kidnapped U.S. citizens is limited."

            Avoid <strong>walking alone</strong> and <strong>displaying</strong> cash and other personal property of
            value. Avoid
            <strong>taking photos</strong> in public, especially
            of government buildings and the airport (which are viewed as places of national security), police
            stations,
            the
            presidential palace, border crossings, and along the river, since doing so may lead to arrest.Lock
            vehicle
            doors and
            keep windows closed when driving. You should not stop at the scene of an accident or at intersections
            where
            people have
            gathered, as mobs can develop quickly. In areas where the roads are in poor condition and the speed
            limit is
            minimal, be
            wary of gangs of street children who may approach your car, open your door, and steal your belongings.
            Roadblocks are
            often found throughout the country, especially near government buildings and installations in Kinshasa,
            and
            should be
            avoided if possible. If stopped at a roadblock, keep doors locked and crack the window in order to
            communicate. Official
            Congolese motorcades pose hazards to motorists and pedestrians.

            Historically, Americans have been the targets of numerous terrorist attacks in Lebanon. The perpetrators
            of
            many of
            these attacks are still present and retain the ability to act. American citizens should thus keep a low

            times and
            79

            locations where
            <strong>Westerners are generally known to congregate</strong>, and should avoid demonstrations and large
            gatherings (DOS,
